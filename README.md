# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework developed with cleanliness, readability, and speed in mind.<br />
Consult the [project website](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all documentation.

Implementation of the supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH). SSDH constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network in which binary codes are learned by the optimization of an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable properties of hash codes. 


This modified caffe distribution provides two objective functions, K1 and K2, to learn efficient binary hash codes.
